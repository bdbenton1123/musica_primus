# musica_primus
JavaScript app that generates music from the first 6,405 prime numbers and plots them on a polar spiral.

This is a simple JavaScript app that calculates the 6,405 primes of 64,000 using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) and plots them on a polar grid, generating a prime spiral.

Additionally, the app can generate music by assigning primes to notes on the C Major scale using the remainder (modulo) of 7 and a corresponding sine wave tone.

Notes only play when a prime is found while counting to 64,000, leading to a unique natural pattern of melody and rhythm that extends to infinity.
